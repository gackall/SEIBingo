      'Take 15 minutes today to discuss the often overlooked topic of mental load within the structural engineering profession. Mental load is seeing the big picture of a project and the behind-the-scenes juggling of priorities, needs, and limited time/resources. It requires thinking of a project as a system combined with recognizing and communicating how small changes in a design can influence the overall project. This way of thinking is crucial for developing better engineers and project managers, yet it is rarely recognized in performance reviews or discussed in the open. While broad, mental load is a learnable skill that can be transferred between engineers through the right mentoring and instruction. As you discuss these topics, think: What do the people you like working with do that makes them great design partners, team members, or supervisors? How do you balance the changing deadlines, moving parts, and different stakeholders in a project? How do you identify tasks that need to be done and how do you determine when a task is completed accurately? What can you do to improve your mental load skills?<br><br>If you would like to learn more about mental load, please read this article on STRUCTURE Magazine by Angelina V. Stasulis, PE, SE: <a href=\"https://www.structuremag.org/article/getting-ahead-by-thinking-ahead-cultivating-mental-load\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.structuremag.org/article/getting-ahead-by-thinking-ahead-cultivating-mental-load</a>',
      'What time management techniques do you use regularly? These can be formal, named techniques, or informal habits you’ve built that you find help you stay organized and on top of the task at hand. How do you determine which tasks to prioritize and triage when you have limited time? Some common time management techniques include the Pickle Jar Theory, the Pomodoro Technique, the 80/20 Rule, or the Time Blocking Method. Different techniques will work better or worse depending on the person, but lessons can be learned from each one!',
      'Block out 20 minutes on your calendars to build a bird’s-eye view of an upcoming project together. Grab a whiteboard or sheet of paper and map out the major phases—concept, design, review, and delivery. As you sketch dates and milestones, you’re modeling how to translate client needs into a structured plan.<br><br>Identify three to five key deliverables and the dependencies between them. Ask your mentee: What tasks must finish before others can start? What information do you need for each subtask and when/from whom will you obtain it? Where could scope changes or external reviews introduce delays? Discuss how you’ll incorporate buffer time for unexpected issues, stakeholder feedback loops, and iteration cycles. Invite them to own updating the calendar as tasks progress and to flag potential roadblocks early.',
      'Take 10 minutes this week to sit down with a colleague and review their resume or statement of qualifications. A second set of eyes can highlight strengths that they may not see themselves, and constructive feedback can make a big difference when applying for jobs, graduate school, or soliciting a project.<br><br>As you review together, discuss how to showcase technical projects, leadership experiences, and community involvement. Encourage them to frame their work in terms of outcomes and impact rather than just tasks. Ask: Does this resume tell a clear story of growth? Does it highlight transferable skills like project management, teamwork, or communication?<br><br>ASCE offers excellent resources on crafting a resume <a href=\"https://collaborate.asce.org/careerbydesign/resources/ce-resume" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.',
      'Mentoring is not only about passing down successes; it is equally about sharing the lessons learned from failures. Take a few minutes to tell a colleague about a professional mistake you made and how you grew from it. This normalizes the idea that mistakes are part of engineering practice and can strengthen resilience. <br><br>As you share, emphasize what you learned, what systems or habits you changed afterward, and how that growth shaped your career. Encourage your colleague to share their own story. Ask: How do you handle setbacks? What strategies do you use to recover quickly and prevent repeat mistakes?',
      'Role-play answering a challenging client or contractor question (e.g., “Why can’t we use less rebar?” or “Why is this beam so deep?”). Discuss how to balance technical accuracy with clear, approachable language. Share strategies for keeping answers concise, respectful, and confident.',
      'Every engineer has a favorite “desk reference.” Take five minutes to show a colleague the reference book, design guide, or manual you rely on most. Explain why it’s valuable, what you use it for, and how you first discovered it. Ask what resources they’ve found most useful, and build a shared list of go-to references.',
      'Engineers often need to sketch details fast. Show a quick drawing shortcut or convention you use to communicate structural ideas clearly. Have your colleague try sketching the same detail. Talk about how visuals can help communicate ideas in video calls.',
      'AI tools can help improve productivity with various day-to-day tasks. Teach a colleague how ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot can be used for quick information search, to improve writing, develop professional sketches for proposals or presentations, write codes to automate a task, etc. Emphasize the need for user judgement and understanding prior to utilizing the information obtained using AI tools.',
      'Pick a detail from a recent project drawing set and explain what each component’s purpose is and the different limit states/design criteria that influenced its design. Where did this detail come from and why was it created? Do you understand why that deck edge angle is ¼” thick and what project conditions might require it to be different?',
      'Pick a clause or topic (e.g., wind loads, seismic detailing, or deflection limits) and compare how two codes approach it (e.g., ACI vs. Eurocode, ASCE vs. older editions). What philosophy differences do you notice? How does this affect design decisions in practice?',
      'Is your colleague preparing for a licensing exam? Have you already been through a similar exam and have passed it? Explain to your colleague your study methodology, resources used and exam preparation tips. Encourage them to keep a “book of mistakes” to keep a note on possible mistakes to avoid in the exam.',
      'Use this free space as an invitation to invest in your community by joining ASCE and its Structural Engineering Institute. Members gain access to Structure magazine, technical journals, research insights, networking events, and discounts on webinars and certifications. Reflect on which SEI technical committee aligns with your goals and how volunteering or presenting can sharpen your leadership. Turn this free space into professional growth: visit <a href=\"https://www.asce.org/join" target=\"_blank\">asce.org/join</a> and choose the SEI division today.',
      'Take a few minutes to reflect on a single task or project milestone whose timeline didn’t go according to plan. Compare the assumptions made when planning the timeline for that task and compare it to what actually happened. Note one root cause for this discrepancy and how it can be reconciled for similar tasks in the future. If it cannot be reconciled, how can you better account for this delay on other timelines?',
      'Identify a recurring task where 20% of effort yields 80% of quality (e.g., load combinations setup, naming conventions, dimensioning, smart components), then write a two‑step checklist. Look for tasks where a small up-front effort can prevent large long-term time sinks or endless revision. Commit to using the checklist for one week and review its impact on speed and error rate.',
      'Review one clause in your favorite structural code with a colleague and then conduct a deep dive into the commentary surrounding it, as well as the research referenced by the commentary. For example, why are certain edge distances, aspect ratios, or thicknesses not allowed for a certain member or connection? Is it based on performance or a lack of testing? What are the limits on a design methodology or empirical equation and where do they come from?',
      'Choose one clash-prone interface (e.g., brace-to-duct, slab depressions, embed plates) and script a three‑question huddle with MEP/architect to preempt rework. Practice how to frame constraints, acceptable ranges, and decision deadlines to reduce downstream friction.',
      'Open the structural general notes or specifications and pick one high‑impact note—such as the Schedule of Special Inspections, governing codes and design criteria, or key material performance requirements. Paraphrase the note in plain language and list two concrete implications for the current project, then trace exactly where it is enforced in details, specifications, calculations, inspection forms, or submittals, identifying the party responsible for action. Call out why this note exists, the risk it is designed to mitigate, and what typically goes wrong when boilerplate text or entire code tables are copied without project‑specific tailoring or cross‑coordination with the rest of the contract documents.',
      'Ethical action is a hallmark of an engineer’s duty to society. Take time with a mentee or colleague to walk through an ethics scenario or case study. How would you approach the situation? How will you respond and who might you notify if unethical action is occurring? <br><br>The National Society of Professional Engineers provides a large database of up-to-date, relevant case studies that are a great starting point: <br><br><a href=\"https://www.nspe.org/career-growth/ethics/board-ethical-review-cases" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nspe.org/career-growth/ethics/board-ethical-review-cases</a>',
      'Encourage a mentee to put together a five-minute presentation about a project they’ve worked on or another technical topic. At your next group or office meeting, arrange for them to present on this topic at the beginning or end of the meeting. Short presentations like this are manageable, but provide an excellent opportunity to improve public speaking skills and learn how to distill complex or lengthy information into crucial points. They also serve to help improve confidence in explaining technical concepts clearly.',
      'Recognize and celebrate a recent success—no matter how small. This could be catching a coordination issue early, running an efficient meeting, or solving a tricky detail. Share how you recognized the win and how you maintain momentum. Invite your colleague to name one of their own recent wins.',
      'Computer programs often have shortcuts that can be very useful to reduce hand strain, minimize repetitive actions, and boost productivity. Some programs even allow for the ability to customize these shortcuts. Unfortunately, these shortcuts are often unknown and go unused. Spend five minutes today to swap favorite shortcuts with a colleague.',
      'Computer software is an important part of an engineer\'s daily workflow. They are used to design members, determine loading, and much more. Yet, these programs often have internal assumptions, simplifications, or criteria that need to be considered. Walk through a quick column, foundation, or beam calculation by hand and compare it with the results from a structural analysis or design program. If a calculation is too time-consuming to do by hand, what is a good back-of-the-napkin estimate that can be used as a sanity check to verify the results from the computer?',
      'Often, typical details are simply copied from one project to another, with little thought as to why they are important and their function within the overall structural system. When not properly understood, this copy-and-paste approach to details can lead to problems down the line in a building design, waterproofing, or integration with other disciplines. Pick a standard detail or two and describe what it is and its purpose. This can be a lap splice, a beam-column joint, a bracing detail, or anything else. Where did this detail come from, how was it derived or designed, and why is it so commonly used?',
      'This is an excellent opportunity to open a dialogue between younger and more experienced engineers. Where do new technologies such as programming, AI, new modeling software, and virtual reality fit into practice? How can these tools boost productivity and allow for more precise designs? However, be sure to discuss the limitations of these technologies as well. Where do hand-calcs and engineering judgement need to be utilized instead or in conjunction with these technologies?'
